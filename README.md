## 🚀 What Are We Building?
This project is an **On-Chain AI Chatbot** powered by the **0G Inference SDK**.  

### How It Works:
1. A user types a message into a web page.  
2. The backend connects to an **on-chain AI model** (e.g., `llama-7b`) using the 0G Inference SDK.  
3. The response is generated **verifiably on-chain**.  
4. The frontend displays the AI’s response — no centralized APIs required.  

By the end, you’ll have a **fully deployable AI app** that is decentralized, transparent, and trustless.

## 🧱 Project Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./img/architecture.png)  
*(Replace with your actual diagram path)*  

**Breakdown:**
- The user types a message in the browser.  
- The frontend sends the message to an **Express backend** using `fetch`.  
- The backend uses the **0G Inference SDK** to interact with the on-chain model service.  
- All requests are **signed by the wallet** and settled on the **0G blockchain**.  
- The model processes the input and returns the result, which the backend sends back to the frontend.

## 🆚 How Is This Different from ChatGPT?
The key difference is **verifiability**:  

With **0G**, you can prove that:  
- ✅ The model being used is authentic (not a fake LLM).  
- ✅ The input hasn’t been tampered with.  
- ✅ The output was actually generated by the model, not faked or cached.  

In contrast, **ChatGPT is centralized**. Users can’t verify:  
- Which model version is running.  
- If the response was truly AI-generated.  
- Whether results were cached, modified, or spoofed.
